### 🌎 Hello, world! I'm Steph 👋🏼 

My internet friends know me as [@_steph.js](https://www.instagram.com/_steph.js/).

I work at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/) building [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub) -- a service that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security findings to give you a comprehensive view of your high-priority security alerts and compliance status across AWS accounts. 

Before that, I was Frontend Developer at [digital marketing startup](https://www.centerfield.com/), and then a Software Engineer at [Sony](https://www.sonynms.com/).

Current favorite stack 🥞: TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Node.js, AWS

Top superpowers according to my manager and teammates at AWS in my 2020 review:
1. Deliver Results
2. Bias for Action
3. Learn and Be Curious
